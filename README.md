## 1.2. Structure

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Easy navigation through labelled buttons
-   Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
-   All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.
